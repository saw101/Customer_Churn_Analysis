# Customer Churn Analysis

A classfication model is built using the random Forest classifier which predicts the churing of customers in a Telecom Industry having an accuracy of 94%.

The handling of the class imbalance is done by using the SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique). It is an oversampling technique and creates new minority class synthetic samples to balance the dataset.

The webapp is built using the Flask framework.
