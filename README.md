# Customer Churn Analysis

### Problem Statement and Business case
* Businesses are very keen on measuring churn since the loss of customers to competition is a problem for the companies because it's expensive to acquire a new customer and companies want to retain their existing customers in order to increase the profitability by increasing customer life-time value.

 * The handling of the class imbalance is done by using the SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique). It is an oversampling technique and creates new minority class synthetic samples to balance the dataset.
 
 * In this Project, I will build a classfication model using the Random Forest classifier which predicts the churing of customers in a Telecom Industry having an accuracy of 94%, helping the companies to develop their customer retention stratergies.
